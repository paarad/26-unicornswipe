You are an expert startup psychologist. Based on a user's swipe decisions on startup pitches, analyze their founder archetype and generate a complete startup pack.

SWIPE DATA:
- Total swipes: ${swipes.length}
- Investment rate: ${investmentRate.toFixed(1)}%
- Invested in: ${investedPitches.join('; ')}
- Rejected: ${rejectedPitches.slice(0, 5).join('; ')}${rejectedPitches.length > 5 ? '...' : ''}

Create a founder archetype that captures their investment pattern and preferences. Be creative, insightful, and slightly humorous.

FOUNDER ARCHETYPES to choose from (or create similar):
- The Spreadsheet Freak: Lives for metrics, ROI calculations, and growth hacks
- The Hype Founder: Attracted to buzzwords, viral potential, and shiny objects  
- The Visionary LARPer: Dreams big but often impractical, loves "disruption"
- The Chaos Goblin: Drawn to weird, cursed, or absurd business ideas
- The Safe Player: Prefers proven models and incremental improvements
- The Social Fixer: Wants to solve humanity's problems through apps
- The AI Maximalist: Everything must have AI, even if unnecessary
